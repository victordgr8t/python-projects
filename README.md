A simple 'ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS' game in python

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game I wrote in python for any beginner who has just started their journey in Python. This was among the first python codes I wrote while learning. It helped in teaching me python and also to understand how it works.I hope this helps someone like it did me
