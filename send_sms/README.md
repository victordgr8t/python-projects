**SEND TEXT MESSAGES USING AMAZON SNS AND PYTHON (Boto3)**


In this mini project, I wrote a python script on how to send SMS messages to a phone number using Python and the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).
Go to my blog to get step by step instruction https://dev.to/victordgr8t/send-text-messages-using-amazon-sns-python-1l04


NB: The number we verified is in the SMS Sandbox in US East(North Virginia) region. When in the sandbox, you can only deliver SMS to the sandbox destination phone numbers you have verified.
When your account is moved out of the sandbox, these restrictions are removed, and you can send SMS messages to any recipient.
To move your account out of the sandbox click the link to get detailed steps from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox-moving-to-production.html
